<h1 align = center>Unix-Project</h1>

<h2>Project description/goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    We would like to make a website hosted on a VPS that will log events from our Minecraft
server.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
We are using a VPS for numerous reasons. Firstly, it is cost-Efficient. We don't need
to buy the hardware and its performance is good enough for our project scale. We can
also increase the scale of the project easily.
  </li>

  <li>
We are using a server because it can be accessed and changed by any admin user
anywhere. The data security also goes to a third party which can handle backups and
other problems.
  </li>

<li>
We are going to use a laptop to demonstrate our project because it will be efficient
and satisfactory enough for our team.
</li>

</ul>
<h2>Major technical solutions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
We imagine the project having a website that is “linked” to our minecraft server. This
website will display logs made by the server. There will also be an input line where you
can write your own commands that will be sent to the minecraft server for processing.
We also want to have a separate tab with our current player and a live map of the server.
  </li>
</ul>
